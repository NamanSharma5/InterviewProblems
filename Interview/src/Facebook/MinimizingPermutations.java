      Approaches:
      Brute Force -
      At each stage generate the possible next steps after considering all possible swaps until end point
       - then run path finding algorithm to find shortest path from start to finish

       Complexity analysis - array length 1 -> 8 - hence many possible rotations each flip very complex
